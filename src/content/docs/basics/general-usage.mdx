title: General Usage
---

The main intended use of the API is to allow 3rd party tools to integrate with Load Order Library.
An example - though a first party tool - is the [MO2 Plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/652) that
uploads the current profile to the site.

A few things to keep in mind when using the API:

:::caution
Please always send requests with `Accept: application/json` header. Due to the underlying framework, without
this, requests (mainly errors) will sometimes be in html format.
:::

## Testing Domains

When testing a program/tool, please make use of these routes.

Base route: `https://testingapi.loadorderlibrary.com/v1`.

To view how lists will look on the website itself, use either:

- https://testing.loadorderlibrary.com
- https://next.loadorderlibrary.com

## Production Domains

When your tool is ready to go to production itself, use these routes.

Base route: `https://api.loadorderlibrary.com/v1`

And the main site is https://loadorderlibrary.com

:::note[Example Syntax]
For the rest of the docs, examples will make use of a `baseRoute` variable, replace that with the route
you are working with.

For example:


import { Code, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
export const jsExample = `async function getUser() {
    const resp = await fetch(\`\$\{baseUrl\}/user\`, {
        headers: {
            Accept: "application/json",
            Authorization: "Bearer <your-api-token>"
        },
    });
    console.log(await resp.json());
}`;

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript" icon="seti:javascript">
    <Code code={jsExample} lang="js" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
